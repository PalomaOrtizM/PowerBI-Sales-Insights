# PowerBI-Sales-Insights
This repository contains my first project using Power BI, where I developed an interactive and insightful sales dashboard. The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data to help stakeholders make informed business decisions.The purpose of the project is to provide information on the company's performance over the past few years, detailing customers, profits, costs, and even predicting future behaviors to make better decisions. The main objective is to present sales information in a clean manner to facilitate understanding through an attractive and easy-to-read report for the user.

### Project Development
The first thing done upon receiving the information was to review all the tables to become familiar with the database. In the first phase, relevant data for the analysis was collected, followed by a thorough cleaning to present a clean report without unnecessary information. The data was normalized to improve the analysis and avoid future confusion or problems. A relational data model was created, establishing primary and foreign keys.

A brief description was added to each table so that the user can understand what each one is about and what information it contains. Columns were deleted and created both in Power BI Desktop and in Power Query to streamline the analysis and the creation of measures.

In the second phase, the project's Mock Up was created in Google Slides, outlining how the required information will be presented. All the necessary measures that would be useful later in the creation of the dashboard were made. For the calculation of measures, it was also necessary to first create calculated columns to facilitate the measures.

In the third phase, visualizations began once the measures were in place and the specified tasks were completed. Data continued to be cleaned, the load of some tables was disabled, a calendar table was determined, all to improve the requested analysis. Finally, the dashboard, visualizations, buttons, titles, and colors were improved to facilitate the reader's understanding.

At the end, we were asked to create a calculation group to optimally display the United States segment, also allowing segmentation by product categories and years. We were also asked for a field parameter with different measures to function as a slicer for our customer map by country.
